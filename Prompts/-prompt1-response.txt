Here's a simple implementation of binary search algorithm in Python:

```python
def binary_search(lst, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(lst) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        guess = lst[mid]
        if guess == target:
            return mid
        elif guess > target:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    return None

# Testing the function
my_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
print(binary_search(my_list, 3))  # Output: 1
print(binary_search(my_list, -1))  # Output: None
```

This algorithm works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the target item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.
