To solve the problem of selecting `k` points on the boundary of a square such that the minimum Manhattan distance between any two selected points is maximized, we can take the following logical approach:

### Logical Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have a square with corners at (0, 0), (0, side), (side, 0), and (side, side).
   - The points provided lie on the boundary of this square.
   - Our goal is to select `k` points such that the minimum Manhattan distance between any pair of selected points is as large as possible.

2. **Manhattan Distance on the Boundary**:
   - Points on the boundary of a square can be divided into four segments:
     1. From (0, 0) to (side, 0)
     2. From (side, 0) to (side, side)
     3. From (side, side) to (0, side)
     4. From (0, side) to (0, 0)
   - For any two points on the boundary, the Manhattan distance can be calculated based on their position on these segments.

3. **Goal - Maximize the Minimum Distance**:
   - We need to distribute the selected `k` points around the boundary such that the minimum distance between any two selected points is maximized.
   - This suggests an even distribution strategy across the perimeter of the square.

4. **Binary Search Approach**:
   - We can use binary search to determine the maximum possible minimum Manhattan distance.
   - The search space for the distance can range from `0` to `2 * side` (the maximum perimeter distance).
   - For each middle point in the binary search, check if it's possible to select `k` points such that the minimum distance between them is at least this middle point.

5. **Feasibility Check**:
   - To check feasibility for a given distance `d`, iterate over the sorted list of points and try to place the next point such that it is at least `d` away from the last selected point.
   - If you can place `k` points this way, the distance `d` is feasible.

6. **Implementation**:
   - Sort the points based on their position on the boundary.
   - Use binary search to find the maximum minimum distance.

### Implementation

Here is the Python function implementing the above logic:

```python
def max_min_manhattan_distance(side, k, points):
    # Helper function to convert a point to its perimeter position
    def point_to_position(x, y):
        if y == 0:
            return x
        elif x == side:
            return side + y
        elif y == side:
            return 3 * side - x
        else:
            return 4 * side - y
    
    # Convert points to their respective positions on the boundary
    positions = sorted([point_to_position(x, y) for x, y in points])
    
    # Function to check if a given minimum distance is possible
    def can_achieve_distance(min_dist):
        count = 1
        last_position = positions[0]
        
        for pos in positions:
            if pos - last_position >= min_dist:
                count += 1
                last_position = pos
                if count == k:
                    return True
                
        return False

    # Binary search for the maximum minimum distance
    low, high = 0, 2 * side
    result = 0
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_achieve_distance(mid):
            result = mid
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    return result

# Example usage
# side = 10, k = 3, points = [[0, 0], [10, 0], [10, 10], [0, 10]]
# max_min_manhattan_distance(side, k, points)
```

This function uses a binary search to determine the maximum possible minimum Manhattan distance between `k` selected points on the boundary of the square. It efficiently checks each candidate distance's feasibility using the sorted positions of the points on the boundary.
