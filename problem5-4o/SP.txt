Intent: Create a python function that for a tree with n nodes rooted at node 0 (numbered from 0 to n-1), where each node i has a value given by values[i], determines the maximum sum of values along any path that starts at a node u and only goes downward in the tree. 

Plan and code: Lets think it step by step:
1. We need to calculate a way to distinguish the different paths that can be taken, from the root to the leaves
2. Once we have each of the paths, calculate wich is the best sum of values along each
3. When we have all of the best sums, return the greatest.

def bestSumDownwardTreePath(parentsList, values):
n = len(parentsList)
tree = [[] for _ in range(n)]

# Build the tree from parentsList
for child, parent in enumerate(parentsList):
    if parent != -1:  # if the parent is not -1 (root)
        tree[parent].append(child)

# A helper function to perform DFS and compute the maximum path sum
def dfs(node):
    # Initialize the maximum sum for the current node to its value
    max_sum = values[node]
    
    # Explore all the children of the current node
    for child in tree[node]:
        max_sum = max(max_sum, values[node] + dfs(child))
    
    return max_sum

# Call dfs starting from the root node (0)
return dfs(0)


Intent: Create a python function that given an integer side, representing the edge length of a square with corners at (0, 0), (0, side), (side, 0), and (side, side) on a Cartesian plane. You are also given a positive integer k and a 2D integer array points, where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents the coordinate of a point lying on the boundary of the square. You need to select k elements among points such that the minimum Manhattan distance between any two points is maximized. Return the maximum possible minimum Manhattan distance between the selected k points. The Manhattan Distance between two cells (xi, yi) and (xj, yj) is |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.
