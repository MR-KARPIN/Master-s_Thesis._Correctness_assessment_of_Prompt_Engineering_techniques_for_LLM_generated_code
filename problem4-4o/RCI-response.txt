Let's re-evaluate the provided solution to ensure it addresses the problem correctly and efficiently:

### Issues Identified

1. **Mixing Strategy**:
   - The current approach attempts to resolve adjacent discrepancies directly by merging any pair where `nums[i] > nums[i + 1]`, but this might not always lead to the minimal number of operations because it treats each descending sequence fix independently without regard to the eventual sequence consistency downstream.
   
2. **Optimal Merging Decision**:
   - The code merges the first available decreasing pair without considering the impact of subsequent changes which could result from merging further along or with different conditions.

### Revised Approach

Given the complexity and issues mentioned, let's redefine how to resolve this:

1. **Focus on Minimum Adjacent Pair Merging**:
   - Always search for the minimum adjacent pair sum in situations where descending order occurs.
   - Ensure these merges lead toward building a non-decreasing sequence intentionally through strategic selection.

2. **Iterate Until Fully Non-Decreasing**:
   - Continuously improve parts of the list showing descending order while maintaining comparatively consistent order through careful back-and-forth checking after merges.

Here’s an updated attempt to resolve the problem:

```python
def minOperationsToNonDecreasing(nums):
    operations = 0

    # Helper to determine if the array is non-decreasing
    def is_non_decreasing(arr):
        return all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))

    while not is_non_decreasing(nums):
        min_sum = float('inf')
        min_index = -1
        
        # Find the minimal sum of two adjacent elements where nums[i] > nums[i + 1]
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            if nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:
                pair_sum = nums[i] + nums[i + 1]
                if pair_sum < min_sum:
                    min_sum = pair_sum
                    min_index = i
        
        # Merge the identified pair with the minimum sum causing the issue
        if min_index != -1:
            nums[min_index] = nums[min_index] + nums[min_index + 1]
            nums.pop(min_index + 1)
            operations += 1

    return operations

# Example Usage
nums = [4, 3, 2, 1]
print(minOperationsToNonDecreasing(nums))  # Outputs the minimum number of operations
```

### Explanation:

- **Systematic Merging**: Each time a decrease is detected (i.e., `nums[i] > nums[i + 1]`), evaluate the least disruptive merge outcome for that step (`nums[i] + nums[i + 1]`).
  
- **Iterative Progress**: Adjusts each incorrect part incrementally — ensures that every replacement moves toward a non-decreasing order, choosing the minimal disturbance option.

- **Backtracking Not Needed Explicitly**: Once merging decisions are effectively directing transformation towards a resolved state, simple back-and-forth adjustments help without deep re-evaluations.

### Summary:

This revised implementation provides a balance between addressing descending pairs through selective merging and readjustment while improving alignment towards a non-decreasing array actively. Additionally, each loop deliberately gauges improvement steps until goals are achieved.
