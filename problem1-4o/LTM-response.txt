To solve the problem of finding the palindrome that can be made by inserting the fewest number of characters into a given string, and ensuring it is the lexicographically earliest one, we can use dynamic programming. The key idea is to determine the minimal number of insertions needed to make a substring a palindrome, and then reconstruct the palindrome from this information.

Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
def min_insertions_palindrome(s: str) -> str:
    n = len(s)
    
    # dp[i][j] will store the minimum number of insertions needed to make s[i:j+1] a palindrome
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Build the dp table
    for length in range(2, n + 1):  # length of the substring
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            if s[i] == s[j]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + 1

    # Reconstruct the palindrome using the dp table
    i, j = 0, n - 1
    res = []
    while i <= j:
        if s[i] == s[j]:
            res.append(s[i])
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i + 1][j] < dp[i][j - 1]:
            res.append(s[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            res.append(s[j])
            j -= 1

    # The first half of the palindrome is in res
    # The second half is the reverse of the first half, without the middle character if the length is odd
    second_half = res[::-1]
    if i - 1 == j + 1:  # odd length palindrome
        res = res + second_half[1:]
    else:
        res = res + second_half

    return ''.join(res)

# Example usage:
s = "abca"
result = min_insertions_palindrome(s)
print(result)  # Outputs: "abcba"
```

### Explanation:
1. **Dynamic Programming Table (`dp`)**: We use a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of insertions needed to make the substring `s[i:j+1]` a palindrome.

2. **Filling the Table**: Start with shorter substrings and move to longer ones. If the characters at the current ends of the substring (i.e., `s[i]` and `s[j]`) are the same, no new insertion is needed beyond those needed for the inner substring (`dp[i+1][j-1]`). If they are different, one insertion is needed, and we take the minimum result from either inserting at the front (`dp[i+1][j]`) or the back (`dp[i][j-1]`).

3. **Reconstructing the Palindrome**: Start from the ends of the string and use the `dp` table to decide whether to move inward from the left or the right. As you move inward, build up the palindrome by adding characters to the result list. Mirror this part to construct the second half, modifying slightly based on whether the length is odd or even.

This approach ensures the minimal number of insertions while maintaining the lexicographically smallest result whenever there are choices to be made.
