Q: You need to create a function in python that for a tree with n nodes rooted at node 0 (numbered from 0 to n-1), where each node i has a value given by values[i], determines the maximum sum of values along any path that starts at a node u and only goes downward in the tree. 

A: To find the maximum sum of values along any path, we need to calculate all of the absolute paths we can take through the tree, theese are the ones from the root to the leaves. Once we have all of them, we have to calculate which is the best sum of values along each and return the greatest between all of the paths.

def bestSumDownwardTreePath(parentsList, values):
n = len(parentsList)
tree = [[] for _ in range(n)]

# Build the tree from parentsList
for child, parent in enumerate(parentsList):
    if parent != -1:  # if the parent is not -1 (root)
        tree[parent].append(child)

# A helper function to perform DFS and compute the maximum path sum
def dfs(node):
    # Initialize the maximum sum for the current node to its value
    max_sum = values[node]
    
    # Explore all the children of the current node
    for child in tree[node]:
        max_sum = max(max_sum, values[node] + dfs(child))
    
    return max_sum

# Call dfs starting from the root node (0)
return dfs(0)

Q: You need to create a function in python that given a string, finds the palindrome that can be made by inserting the fewest number of characters into the given string. If there are multiple palindromes with the same minimum number of insertions, return the lexicographically earliest palindrome (the first one alphabetically).
