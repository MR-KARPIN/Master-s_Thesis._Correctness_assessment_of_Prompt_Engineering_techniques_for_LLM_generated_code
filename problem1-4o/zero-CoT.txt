You need to create a function in python that given a string, finds the palindrome that can be made by inserting the fewest number of characters into the given string. If there are multiple palindromes with the same minimum number of insertions, return the lexicographically earliest palindrome (the first one alphabetically). First, create a sequence of logical reasonings. Once you have it, create the function following that sequence.
