Q: We need to create a singular python function that for a tree with n nodes rooted at node 0 (numbered from 0 to n-1), where each node i has a value given by values[i], determine the maximum sum of values along any path that starts at a node u and only goes downward in the tree. 

A: To answer the question to "what is the path with the greatest value in the tree?" we need to respond to "What are the different paths?" and "what is the best sum of values along each of the paths?" to respond. 

Q: We need to create a singular python function that given an integer n and an undirected, weighted tree rooted at node 0 with n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1. This is represented by a 2D array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi] indicates an edge from node ui to vi with weight wi. The weighted median node is defined as the first node x on the path from ui to vi such that the sum of edge weights from ui to x is greater than or equal to half of the total path weight. You are given a 2D integer array queries. For each queries[j] = [uj, vj], determine the weighted median node along the path from uj to vj. Return an array ans, where ans[j] is the node index of the weighted median for queries[j].
