Let's go through the function again, identify any potential issues or areas for improvement, and ensure the logic is correctly implemented.

### Possible Issues and Corrections:

1. **LCA Calculation**: The LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) calculation using binary lifting appears correct but still requires careful handling based on initialization, especially if the parent relationship was inaccurately set initially.

2. **Weighted Median Calculation**: In the `find_weighted_median` function, the logic doesn't properly account for cases where the weighted path from both sides might meet the threshold differently; we need to distinguish this correctly.

3. **Redundant Logic**: Overhead and redundancy should be minimized for clarity and efficiency, and checks such as bounds should ensure correctness.

4. **Edge Cases**: We need to ensure the code handles edge cases, such as smallest path trees, effectively through cumulative weight management.

### Corrected and Improved Function:

```python
def weighted_median_nodes(n, edges, queries):
    from collections import defaultdict, deque

    # Create an adjacency list for the tree
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v, w in edges:
        tree[u].append((v, w))
        tree[v].append((u, w))
    
    # Precompute parent, depth, and cumulative weight using DFS
    parent = [-1] * n
    depth = [0] * n
    cumulative_weight = [0] * n
    
    def dfs(node, par, dep, cum_weight):
        parent[node] = par
        depth[node] = dep
        cumulative_weight[node] = cum_weight
        for neighbor, weight in tree[node]:
            if neighbor != par:
                dfs(neighbor, node, dep + 1, cum_weight + weight)
    
    dfs(0, -1, 0, 0)

    # Binary lifting for LCA
    LOG = n.bit_length()  # sizing up the log
    up = [[-1] * LOG for _ in range(n)]

    # Initialize up table
    for i in range(n):
        up[i][0] = parent[i]
    
    for j in range(1, LOG):
        for i in range(n):
            if up[i][j - 1] != -1:
                up[i][j] = up[up[i][j - 1]][j - 1]

    def lca(u, v):
        # LCA calculation
        if depth[u] < depth[v]:
            u, v = v, u
        
        # Equalizing the depth of u to v
        diff = depth[u] - depth[v]
        for i in range(LOG):
            if (diff >> i) & 1:
                u = up[u][i]
                
        if u == v:
            return u
        
        # Lift both nodes until we get to a common ancestor
        for i in reversed(range(LOG)):
            if up[u][i] != up[v][i]:
                u = up[u][i]
                v = up[v][i]
        
        return parent[u]

    def find_weighted_median(ancestor, u, v):
        # Calculate the total path weight
        total_weight = cumulative_weight[u] + cumulative_weight[v] - 2 * cumulative_weight[ancestor]
        half_weight = total_weight / 2

        # Try both directions to find the median node
        def trace_path(start, end, half_weight):
            weight_acc = 0
            current_node = start
            while current_node != end:
                next_node = parent[current_node]
                edge_weight = cumulative_weight[current_node] - cumulative_weight[next_node]
                weight_acc += edge_weight
                if weight_acc >= half_weight:
                    return current_node
                current_node = next_node
            return end

        median_u = trace_path(u, ancestor, half_weight)
        median_v = trace_path(v, ancestor, half_weight)

        # Return the deeper of both median nodes
        return median_u if depth[median_u] >= depth[median_v] else median_v

    ans = []
    for u, v in queries:
        ancestor = lca(u, v)
        median_node = find_weighted_median(ancestor, u, v)
        ans.append(median_node)
    
    return ans

# Example usage with tests
n = 5
edges = [
    [0, 1, 3],
    [1, 2, 2],
    [1, 3, 3],
    [3, 4, 4]
]
queries = [
    [0, 4],
    [2, 4]
]

print(weighted_median_nodes(n, edges, queries))  # Expected output logic
```

### Key Improvements:

- **Trace Functionality**: Created a helper function `trace_path` to find if the half-path weight condition is met when going from a node towards the ancestor.

- **LCA Handling**: Verified that using binary lifting is correctly initialized and adjusted, ensuring ancestor relationships are set properly.

- **Median Node Selection**: The selection of the median node is now effectively compared by depth or efficiently within the half-path detection without unnecessary duplicates.

- **Clarity and Efficiency**: The code consolidated BFS/DFS separation, ensuring traversal is single, utilizing one matrix while treating weights and parent data structures accurately.
