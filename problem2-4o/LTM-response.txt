To solve this problem, you need to determine the maximum profit achievable given the constraints of the stock prices, discounts based on hierarchy, and the budget. Here's a step-by-step approach to constructing the Python function:

1. **Parse the Input**: You have the number of employees `n`, the `present` prices array, the `future` prices array, the `hierarchy` array, and the `budget`.

2. **Calculate Potential Profits**: For each employee, calculate the potential profit if their stock is bought at the given present price and sold at the expected future price. Profit is defined as `future[i] - present[i]`.

3. **Apply Discounts**: Using the hierarchy, adjust the present prices to account for possible discounts. If an employee's direct boss buys their stock, the employee can buy at half price. This requires a strategy to decide optimally which stocks should be bought to maximize the discount effect.

4. **Maximize Profits Within Budget**: With the adjusted present prices, determine the best way to purchase stocks to maximize profit without exceeding the budget. This involves selecting a subset of employees whose stocks can be bought within the budget for the highest profit.

Here's the Python function implementing this logic:

```python
def maxProfit(n, present, future, hierarchy, budget):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Calculate direct profits without discounts
    profits = [future[i] - present[i] for i in range(n)]
    
    # Create a mapping of each employee to their direct boss
    boss_map = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in hierarchy:
        boss_map[u - 1].append(v - 1)  # Convert to 0-based index
    
    # Adjust present prices with potential discounts
    adjusted_present = present[:]
    visited = [False] * n
    
    def apply_discount(employee, discount_applied=False):
        if visited[employee]:
            return
        visited[employee] = True
        if discount_applied:
            adjusted_present[employee] = present[employee] // 2
        for subordinate in boss_map[employee]:
            apply_discount(subordinate, True)
    
    # Try applying discount starting from the CEO downwards
    apply_discount(0)
    
    # Calculate profits with adjusted prices
    adjusted_profits = [future[i] - adjusted_present[i] for i in range(n)]
    
    # Dynamic programming to find the maximum profit within the budget
    dp = [0] * (budget + 1)
    
    for i in range(n):
        cost = adjusted_present[i]
        profit = adjusted_profits[i]
        if profit > 0:  # Only consider stocks with potential profit
            for b in range(budget, cost - 1, -1):
                dp[b] = max(dp[b], dp[b - cost] + profit)
    
    return max(dp)

# Example usage:
# n = 5
# present = [3, 8, 5, 5, 7]
# future = [10, 12, 8, 9, 10]
# hierarchy = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5]]
# budget = 14
# print(maxProfit(n, present, future, hierarchy, budget))  # Output: Maximum profit
```

This function considers:
- Calculating profits for each employee.
- Applying discounts based on hierarchy.
- Using dynamic programming to select the optimal set of stocks to buy within the budget for maximum profit.
