Q: We need to create a python function that for a tree with n nodes rooted at node 0 (numbered from 0 to n-1), where each node i has a value given by values[i], determine the maximum sum of values along any path that starts at a node u and only goes downward in the tree. 

A: To answer the question to "what is the path with the greatest value in the tree?" we need to respond to "What are the different paths?" and "what is the best sum of values along each of the paths?" to respond. 

Q: We need to create a python function where you are given an integer n, representing the number of employees in a company. Each employee is assigned a unique ID from 1 to n, and employee 1 is the CEO. You are given two 1-based integer arrays, present and future, each of length n, where present[i] represents the current price at which the ith employee can buy a stock today; And future[i] represents the expected price at which the ith employee can sell the stock tomorrow. The company's hierarchy is represented by a 2D integer array hierarchy, where hierarchy[i] = [ui, vi] means that employee ui is the direct boss of employee vi.

Additionally, you have an integer budget representing the total funds available for investment. However, the company has a discount policy: if an employee's direct boss purchases their own stock, then the employee can buy their stock at half the original price (floor(present[v] / 2)). Return the maximum profit that can be achieved without exceeding the given budget. Note: You may buy each stock at most once. You cannot use any profit earned from future stock prices to fund additional investments and must buy only from budget.
